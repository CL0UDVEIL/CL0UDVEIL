### 🔺 : **𝐏𝐨𝐧𝐲𝐭𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨**

• Usually on Island building, Docks, Rps, i am also in the Roblox Area (under bakery) or market. Sometimes i visit safe server 2 w my friends / collecting

• Most of the time i prefer to sit alone, but sometimes i might be sitting w friends / my partner

• C+H Tag: cuddle freely! (unless i'm tagged w **DNI/DNIUF/DNIUIS**) i don't talk often when sitting
w someone , but i prefer sending a whisper to start a convo.

• I do not support NSFW humor , block freely who mildly annoys me.
